            The Renegade Girls Tinkering Club offers fun and community for children to explore the world of tinkering and making. Children get hands-on with their peers to see how things work. Tinkering, a process involving hands-on discovery, and trial and error toward a goal, helps girls develop grit and gives a solid foundation for STEM skills. Founded by mothers in STEM careers working to change the vast gender imbalance in their fields, the Renegade Girls Tinkering Club inspires girls to keep their love of scientific exploration.
