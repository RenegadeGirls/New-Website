                    The Renegade Girls Tinkering Club runs exciting summer camps in San Francisco for elementary school kids. We founded the Renegade Girls Tinkering Club to inspire girls and underrepresented people to love tinkering and making! We partner with Summer Together to enable low income kids to attend our camp for free, and fundraise for a sliding scale program.

                    A girl-only environment to provide peer support, where every girl’s contribution is valuable and heard! It's no secret that women are tragically underrepresented in STEM fields. Girls learn from a young age that they can step confidently into STEM fields. Our coed programs welcome kids from underrepresented groups to also open the door to STEM in a supportive environment.

                    We learn by doing with our hands, building, trying, designing, and repeating. Tinkering is the act of taking something apart in order to learn how it works. Then, putting it back together and improving on its design. Hands-on with trial and error. Experiential learning.

                &emsp;&emsp;&ensp; Each week of STEM camp will focus on a theme and each day our campers will explore this theme through a series of hands-on projects and guest speakers. There are also multiple recess times for active bodies, and opportunities for reflection.

                &emsp;&emsp;&ensp; From the moment our club members arrive, they are surrounded by successful, smart, trailblazing role models who encourage them to pursue their love of science, exploration and building. We create a nurturing environment that focuses on building community.
