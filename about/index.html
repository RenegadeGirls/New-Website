                    A girl-only environment to provide peer support, where every girl’s contribution is valuable and heard! It's no secret that women are tragically underrepresented in STEM fields. Girls learn from a young age that they can step confidently into STEM fields. Our coed programs welcome kids from underrepresented groups to also open the door to STEM in a supportive environment.

                    We learn by doing with our hands, building, trying, designing, and repeating. Tinkering is the act of taking something apart in order to learn how it works. Then, putting it back together and improving on its design. Hands-on with trial and error. Experiential learning.

            The Renegade Girls Tinkering Club offers fun and community for children to explore the world of tinkering and making. Children get hands-on with their peers to see how things work. Tinkering, a process involving hands-on discovery, and trial and error toward a goal, helps girls develop grit and gives a solid foundation for STEM skills. Founded by mothers in STEM careers working to change the vast gender imbalance in their fields, the Renegade Girls Tinkering Club inspires girls to keep their love of scientific exploration.
