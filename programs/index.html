                &emsp;&emsp;&ensp; Each week of STEM camp will focus on a theme and each day our campers will explore this theme through a series of hands-on projects and guest speakers. There are also multiple recess times for active bodies, and opportunities for reflection.

                &emsp;&emsp;&ensp; From the moment our club members arrive, they are surrounded by successful, smart, trailblazing role models who encourage them to pursue their love of science, exploration and building. We create a nurturing environment that focuses on building community.
